## Sensor Fusion Demo: Camera and LiDAR Integration

### Overview
This video presents a compelling demonstration of sensor fusion technology, showcasing the seamless integration of data from a camera and a LiDAR sensor. Our aim is to provide a unified view that leverages the high-resolution imagery of the camera with the precise depth information from the LiDAR, offering a comprehensive perspective of the environment.

### About the Demo
- **Technology Used**: The fusion process combines a standard RGB camera feed with point cloud data captured from a LiDAR sensor.
- **Objective**: The primary goal is to illustrate how combining these two data sources can result in a more detailed and accurate representation of the surroundings, essential for applications like autonomous navigation, advanced robotics, and environmental monitoring.
- **Methodology**: The video demonstrates how each frame from the camera is overlaid with corresponding LiDAR data points. This overlay provides a unique visualization where the depth information from the LiDAR enhances the camera's two-dimensional imagery, offering clues about object distances, sizes, and spatial relationships that are not apparent in standard video footage.

### Key Highlights
- **Real-time Processing**: Notice the real-time rendering of LiDAR data on the video, showcasing the system's capability to process and fuse data on-the-fly.
- **Depth Perception**: Pay attention to how objects at different distances are accurately represented, giving a sense of depth in a normally flat image.
- **Object Detection and Classification**: Observe how the fusion aids in more robust object detection and classification, an essential feature for autonomous systems.
